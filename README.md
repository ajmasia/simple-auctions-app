## Documentation

This project it's a simple auction application. As a buyer, you have to enter the maximum price you are willing to pay for a product, and as a seller, you have to enter the minimum price for which you are willing to sell the product. Finally, the app will show your the result in a simple popup.

If you are in the middle of an auction and return to the home, the user receives a notification.

## App config

This project use the OpenWeather API to get cities weather data. You will need a valid API key to use it. Currently the project use a `setTimeout` to simulate a Delay while the app receive new data and can show an spinner. Ideally, make the call to the api at the beginning of the app.

Before run the app, you have to install all project dependences and set the config file renaming the `example.config.js` to `config.js`:

```js
export const appConfig = {
  openWeatherAPIKey: '',
  openWeatherAPIUrl: 'http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/',
  coords: {
    lat: null,
    long: null,
  },
  units: 'metric',
  tempUnit: 'CÂº',
  lang: 'es',
  currency: 'EUR',
  currencyDigits: 2,
}
```

To get the data from `Huesca`, you need to config this coords:

```json
{
  lat: 42.1382,
  long: -0.4081,
},
```
